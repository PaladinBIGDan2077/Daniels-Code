Description:
For my first ever project, I was required to write a program which calculates the approximate human population
for every ten years since 10,000 BCE until 2100 AD. Using the logistic population equation, my program calculates the
population based on six different growth rate values: 0.07%, 0.08%, 0.09%, 0.10%, 0.11%, and 0.12%. In addition to
growth rate, it also had to calculate for  three different limiting populations (8,000,000,000, 10,900,000,000, 
and 12,000,000,000), yielding 18 separate data sets. After the data is successfully processed, each of the 18 population
data sets are placed on a three graphs, each separated by the limiting population. This is saved as a jpeg within the present
working directory of the python interpreter. Lastly, I was required to locate a specific combination of the limiting population
and growth rate that approximates the 2020 world population (~7,800,000,000). I assume that the closest value will yield
the best represented growth rate based on the recommend population limit.

Overall, what I have here is nice. I am proud of the technique I used to generate the 18 data sets. Its a clever use
of FOR loops, the first represents the changing growth rates, the second represents the changing population limits, and the
last represents each population counted from t = 0 (10,000 BCE) to t = 12101 (2100 AD) based on increments of one decade. Each time
the population set is calculated, it is appended to a list as an element. By the end of the loop's run it would total 21,798 separate decades.
All of it condensed into on list: population. While some parts definitely can be streamlined, I am satisfied with what I have created.
This programs marks the first use of a program stopwatch. While it is unimportant for the goal, I find it useful in determining how long the program takes to complete the process.

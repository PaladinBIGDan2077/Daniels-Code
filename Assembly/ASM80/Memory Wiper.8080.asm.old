;   Description:  A memory eraser program. It essentially clears the entire system of 
;                 memory. It will perform either one or all of the erasures, as defined, 
;                 up to 16 times. Supports writing zeros, ones, alternating zeros and ones, 
;                 alternating ones and zeros, and custom value. 
;
;
;       Mathematical Formula: A + B = C 
;
;       Input Memory Address  A, B: 0x0100, 0x0102
;       Output Memory Address C: 0x0104

	            INR         M			;   Increment the H-L register by 1, forcing the pair to point at the adjacent memory address
	            JMP         0x0010		;   Jumps the program counter to memory address 0x0010.
	            .ORG        $0040       ;   Sets the CPU's program counter to 40. Programming will be entered from memory address 0x0040 onward.

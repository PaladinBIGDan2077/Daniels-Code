# Daniel's Code

Welcome Everyone! My name is Daniel J. Lomis. I am currently a student at Northern Virginia Community College.
I will be uploading the RAW code for all of my programs that I will write at school. I will upload older projects
as well. I will strive to keep everything under the GNU General Public License v3.0.

# Daniel's BIGRepo
Welcome everyone! My name is Daniel. I am currently a student at Northern Virginia Community College, Annandale Campus.
I will occasionally upload my programs here. These will vary widely in genre and language, as some will be assignments from courses. Feel free to download, copy, and try some out for yourself! 

<b>NOTE: I have made no attempt to maintain crossplatform compatibility with my Python programs!</b> Some of these programs make use of the<i> os.system </i>function, which was written based on the Windows command prompt commands. There are a few programs that also reference one or more files, and output them as well. Those programs are written with the Windows file/folder structure in mind. 

<b><i>If you plan to use these programs, you may likely have to modify them slighly to work properly for mac or linux, or your specific configuration.</b></i>

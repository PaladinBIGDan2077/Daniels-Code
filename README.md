# Daniel's BIGRepo

Welcome everyone! My name is Daniel. I am currently a student at Northern Virginia Community College, generally Annandale Campus.
I will occasionally upload my programs here. Programs will vary widely in genre and language, as some will be assignments from courses. Feel free to download, copy, and try some out for yourself! 

<b>NOTE: I have made no attempts to design the Python programs to be universal to any operating system!</b>

Some of my python programs make use of<i> os.system </i>function, which uses Windows-based console commands. Their are a few programs that also reference one or more files, and out them as well. Those programs are written with the Windows file/folder structure in mind. 

<b><i>If you plan to use my programs, you may likely have to modify them slighly to work properly for mac or linux, or your specific configuration.</b></i>
